💡 What You’ll Learn

This whitepaper addresses the challenge of assuring quality in Al agents by introducing a holistic evaluation framework. The necessary technical foundation for this is Observability, built on three pillars: Logs (the diary), Traces (the narrative), and Metrics (the health report), enabling a continuous feedback loop using scalable methods like LLM-as-a-Judge and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) evaluation.
